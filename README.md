# What's for Dinner?

### Abstract:
[//]: <> (Briefly describe what you built and its features. What problem is the app solving? How does this application solve that problem?)

Whatâ€™s for dinner? The ultimate question. Every day, we have to decide what to make or order for dinner. And every day, we hem and haw until someone involved makes a decision.

With this application, all that hemming and hawing is rendered unnecessary! All the user has to do is select the type of item they're looking for (sides, mains, desserts) and at the push of a button, the app will randomly tell them exactly what to eat! There's even an option to select a full meal, if the user is looking for one-stop-shopping.

### Installation Instructions:
[//]: <> (What steps does a person have to take to get your app cloned down and running?)

1. Fork this project to the user's own Github account
2. Clone the repository to the user's local machine
3. `cd` into the project
4. `open index.html` to launch the app in the user's default web browser

The app can also be accessed live here: https://ericahagle.github.io/whats-for-dinner/

### Preview of App:
[//]: <> (Provide ONE gif or screenshot of your application - choose the "coolest" piece of functionality to show off.)

### Context:
[//]: <> (Give some context for the project here. How long did you have to work on it? How far into the Turing program are you?)

**Kickoff Date:** Tuesday, September 5, 2023</br>
**Due Date:** Sunday, September 10, 2023

As of this Sunday, September 10, 2023, and the end of this project, I will have completed the third week of FE Mod 1 at Turing School of Software & Design.

### Learning Goals:
[//]: <> (What were the learning goals of this project? What tech did you work with?)

- Gain experience building an application that utilizes HTML, CSS, and JavaScript
- Write HTML and CSS to match a provided comp
- Understand how to listen to and respond to user events using querySelectors, eventListeners, and classLists
- Individualize your programming skill set

### Wins + Challenges:
[//]: <> (What are 2-3 wins you have from this project? What were some challenges you faced - and how did you get over them?)

**Wins:**
- I was able to get the basic mock done with HTML and CSS in about a half hour. It felt good to at least know enough off the bat to get the basics done.
- Even though it wasn't part of Iteration 1 nor the CYOA that I chose, I wanted the styling of the button to be a bit more slick and dynamic. So, I figured out how to disable/enable it at appropriate times and added a hover state to give it a little extra flair.
- Getting the text to dynamically change sizes between single meal elements and an entire meal was a big win for me.

**Challenges:**
- Figuring out how to get the text to dynamically change sizes between single meal elements and an entire meal with a big challenge. I did a lot of googling and all the answers involved stuff that I just didn't want to do. It finally just kinda dawned on me that I could use classes to make it happen, and it was a real "duh" moment for me. After all that googling, I just kinda thought of it in my own head.
- Figuring out how to get the button to be disabled/enabled at the right times was also a challenge. I basically tried several things in my own code (moving around the innerHTML updates into different functions to see what would happen) until I finally got the functionality the way I wanted it. Once again, this was a big win for me because I figured it out on my own, instead of having to find it on the internets!
